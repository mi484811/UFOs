# UFOs

# Overview of the analysis:
Refactor code to allow users to search through data with multiple criteria simultaneously. The filters added are for the city, state, country, and shape. 

# Results:
There are 5 different searches that the dataset can be filtered through. 

# Summary:
The drawback of this webpage is the limitation of the dataset. New information would have to be continuously added to the dataset. 
A recommendation would be linked to the news article or social media if any sightings should be added to the data. A filter should be added that clears the previous search.
